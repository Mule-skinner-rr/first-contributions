/*
 * From Hanley and Koffman's "Problem Solving
 * and Program Design in C", 7th Ed.
 * Chapter 7, section 9, Programming question #2:
 *
 * Write a function that determines who has won
 * a game of tic-tac-toe. The function should first
 * check all rows to see whether one player occupies
 * all the cells in one row, next check all columns,
 * and then check the two diagonals.  The function
 * should return a value from the enumerated type
 * {no_winner, x_wins, o_wins}.
 */

/*
 * The hardest thing to figure
 * out was how to stop the inner 'for'
 * loop after it checked the first row.
 *
 * I added the curly braces
 * after the first 'for' loop, then
 * added the 'results' function after
 * the inner loop exited to check a
 * winner after tallying that row.
